# A Kennel Atendee Tracker
This app was made for businesses that board animals at their facility. 

# To Start
### Inspiration:   
I work at a kennel where I care for dogs who are boarding there. We keep track of these animals with paper cards that have their information. These paper cards are kept in a file organized by owners last name. Finding the cards can be a time consuming task and it is very easy for cards to get lost. This project is meant to simulate these cards in an app that keeps them organized better and makes it easier to find these cards.  
The photo below is what these cards look like:

# Technologies

 # Need To Fix
 When moving a card from present cards to all cards you have to reload the page to see the card moved. 

 # Future Enhancment
 Ability to search through the cards by last name of animal/owner.  
 The cards being sorted alphabetically. Adding more info boxes for the animals cards.   
 Being able to change the way the animals are sorted in the all cards category.  
 Having an electronic signature option for the event of emergency signature from the owner.
